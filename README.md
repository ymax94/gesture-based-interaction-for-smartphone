# gesture-based-interaction-for-smartphone
This project is involved in developing a frame work using sound-based gesture sensing approach that utilizes the existing audio hardware of mobile devices (currently supports only android). This technique is based on Doppler Effect or Doppler Shift. This frame work uses the existing speakers of the smart phone to generate tones between 18-22 kHz, which are inaudible. We then use the existing microphones on these same devices to pick up the reflected signal and estimate the motion and gesture through the observed frequency shifts.Till now we managed to reach a good level of accuracy in recognizing gestures, at the end we aim to be able to recognize 4 gestures (towards and away from the device using only signal processing) with high accuracy two more gestures (Swipe left and swipe right) can be easily interpreted by giving them as input to SVM.
